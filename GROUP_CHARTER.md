# DARE UK Interest Group Charter: Service Federation for Sensitive Data Research

## The WHY

“Sensitive data services” is a broad-brush landscape covering trusted research environments,
secure data environments and other online services designed to enable safe, approved research with
health, administrative and other types of sensitive data. “Federation” assumes a model of this landscape
where sources of data and secure analytical services are distributed across the country and need to be
connected across the Internet to support research on linked data at scale.

DARE UK have proposed a low-level infrastructure to support this federated picture but there is a much
broader landscape of data, governance and application services to be layered on top to deliver the national
research environment we all seek. This group brings together people interested in specifying this broad
service landscape and developing the long-term technical architecture for sensitive data research within the
UK.

User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address: The IG’s starting point is the DARE UK “Federated
Architecture Blueprint” which captures the overall drive towards a federation of services for research with
sensitive data. This group’s focus is very much the “federated” aspect of the landscape and how best to
connect services and data sources in trustworthy ways.

## The WHAT

### Objectives:
Possible focus areas include:
- Evolution of the federated architecture blueprint to v3.
- Specifications for:
   - Services for federated querying of distributed data;
   - Services for data discovery, exploration and harmonisation;
   - Services for data linkage;
- Common federation information model;
- Federation governance models;
- International connections (eg, with RDA, EU Data Spaces initiatives).

### Outcomes:
The IG sees itself as the owner and long-term maintainer of the technical architectural vision for
the ecosystem of sensitive data research services in the UK, and as a coordination group for discussions
around the focus areas above and a spawning ground for Working Groups on particular topics within those
areas.

## The HOW
### Participation/Collaboration:
The group welcomes participants from service builders, research users,
information governance professionals and data custodians from across the landscape.

### Mechanism:

- Group output will be managed and maintained at https://github.com/DAREUK/tre-federation
- [Describe how often the group will meet and sustain progress between meetings]
