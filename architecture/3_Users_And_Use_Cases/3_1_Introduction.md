**[DARE UK Federated Architecture Blueprint](../)**      v2.2

# Chapter 3 Users and use-cases
## 3.1 Introduction

By some measures the UK already has a research landscape for sensitive data that is
federated. Data are distributed and distant from researchers, services are available to link
datasets together and trusted research environments exist to bring all these things together.
Federation is ad hoc, though, friction is high and end-to-end researcher productivity can be
painfully low.

The SDRI Federation is not so much a new thing as the improvement of an existing thing. Our
goal is to remove the ad hoc, reduce the friction and increase the baseline trustworthiness of
connections between data providers, TREs and researchers. From a researcherâ€™s perspective
the ideal SDRI Federation is something that they will never actually see; rather they will see
its positive impact on their productivity.

With this view in mind, many of the important drivers of the Federation are non-functional
rather than functional. They are about increasing trust and improving performance rather
than adding new features per se. We advance the argument that a secure federation with an
agreed rulebook and matching organisational model creates an environment which supports
innovation, providing a common, trustworthy foundation which enables the development of
new services and enhanced capabilities while maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of
the whole.
