# Chapter 3 Users and use-cases
## User stories and requirements mapping

Analysis of both data usage patterns and user personas has identified a number of key
requirements for the overall federation and for individual services within it [2].
Some of these requirements are functional use-cases, more are non-
functional constraints, and many are higher level “user stories” to be followed up in later
development stages.

Note that these requirements are by no means exhaustive. Nor are they detailed enough to
begin software implementation. They are, however, sufficient to provide a framing set for this
architecture. The “master list” of requirements can be found in Appendix D.

Below we list the user stories derived from our personas, ordered by the “most popular”. We
have incorporated a number of genuine, current cross-domain research projects as
motivations for our “Researcher” personas. These were generated in a workshop held in
February 2024 which brought together more than 50 UK based researchers and public
participants to surface use cases for linking sensitive data [32].
These examples provide useful first insight into the spread of data types in use in research
projects today, and are recorded from use-case U42 onwards. We have assigned them as
closely as possible to one of our four researcher personas, and we note the types of data
required by each.

Further requirements, derived from system-level considerations and an ongoing review of the
existing landscape, appear throughout this document and are flagged as they arise.
