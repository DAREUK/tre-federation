# Chapter 4 Federated architecture: infrastructure layer
## 4.3 Participants

Participants is the general name for the services connected together to form the SDRI Federation.

In this document we focus on securing the connections between Participants within a federated network. We must be aware that any Participant judged (by Federation governance processes) “good enough” to join the Federation must have an appropriate level of security around all participating service elements. This may mean that all Federation Participants must demonstrate a certain level of secure hosting and management, not merely deploy a Federation Security Server. This will form one aspect of the governing rules for the Federation.
