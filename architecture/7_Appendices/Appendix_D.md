# Appendix D. Master requirements table

In the table below we follow the conventions of IETF BCP 14 (RFC2119 & RFC8174) [[39]](../References.md#ref-39), vis:
> The capitalised key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14.

From each requirement we identify the need for one or more service capabilities or information contexts, or both, noted in the primary, secondary or tertiary “scope” columns. “F/N” codes for functional or non-functional requirements; “St” indicates the strength of the requirement using the above MoSCoW abbreviations. The second column indicates which user story from Chapter 3 raises this requirement. Some requirements arise in multiple stories and have multiple entries in this table.

In the final column we cross-reference each requirement with relevant statements from [version 1.0.0 of the SATRE specification](https://satre-specification.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0.0/index.html) for standard TRE architectures. A key output of the SATRE project [[25]](../References.md#ref-25) this specification “aims to standardise the capabilities of TREs, making it easier for users, operators, and developers to work with sensitive data, and making the operation of TREs more transparent to data owners and the general public”. 

Many user stories as expressed at the moment are high level or require further analysis and have not yet been tagged with system level requirements. They are not presented in this table.
