# Chapter 6 Federated architecture: organisational layer
## 6.1 Overview

Chapters [4](../4_Infrastructure_Layer/4_1_Introduction.md) and [5](../5_Data_Layer/5_1_Introduction.md) have attempted to distil and write down the technical specifics of a federated architecture for TRE services – the “what” of the SDRI Federation. This chapter is much more open. Reaching agreement on an organisational model to manage the required new elements of standards and core services – the “how” – must be done through wider community processes.

The functionality required of a federated architecture implies a certain logical organisational structure, as captured in the preceding chapters. However, there is flexibility in how that logical structure could be realised in practice, depending on how the community of potential Participants might agree on its setup and operation.

To meet the public need for a more standardised, more trustworthy environment, the Federation needs to be real, in the sense of some kind of membership organisation with rules and standards. For the Federation to be real it will need a Federation Authority (FA) to act at least as gatekeeper and maintainer of standards. 

The rules of participation for the Federation need to be agreed by all relevant stakeholders, and captured in a “Federation Rulebook”. The role of the FA then becomes one of maintaining the Rulebook and overseeing its implementation. The Rulebook should cover the “how to” for at least the following:
 * Agree baseline technical standards for the Federation (as described in Chapters 4 and 5). This may involve defining or approving invitations to tender for technology suppliers of Federation services.
 * Agree baseline procedures for key events: onboarding a new Participant; offloading a departing Participant; etc.
 * Agree baseline maturity or accreditation standards for Federation Participants. This could involve setting minimum capabilities for new Participants accompanied by continual improvement plans towards nationally-agreed standards.
 * Agree the setup and operation of trust services, trust anchors and frameworks – essentially who is able to vouch for and sign identity assertions made by Participants, and how.
 * Agree the setup and operation of registry services. 
 * Agree baseline training or accreditation standards for Federation users, including service operators, Researcher PIs and other researchers.
 * Approve new Participants joining the Federation.
 * Approve Participants leaving the Federation. (This may be trumped by contractual arrangements arising from the joining process.)
 * Approve technical changes with implications for, or impact on, part or the whole of the Federation, including:
   - changes to Federation standard software, for instance changes to Federation Services software;
   - changes to data exchange protocols or formats;
   - changes to metadata standards.
 * Oversee regular audit and accreditation for the Federation as a whole. 

Note that the governance focus of the FA is emphatically on what here is new: interoperability standards, service onboarding, coordinated change management and incident response. The existing stakeholders already have governance arrangements in place to enable research with sensitive data within TREs. The FA should not disrupt existing data governance arrangements for participants wanting to join, but should instead complement them.
