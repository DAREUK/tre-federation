# TRE Federation Working Group Code of Conduct
#### (from DARE UK Working Groups Code of Conduct)

The DARE UK Programme started in July 2021 with a vision to enable a step-change in the UK’s national
research capability for secure sharing, linkage, and analysis of sensitive data for research and innovation
at scale for public benefit. More specifically, DARE UK seeks to drive forward the creation of a secure
network of trusted research environments (TREs), joined through federation and interoperability to
support cross-domain, cross-jurisdictional linkage, and analysis of sensitive data for research in the
public good.

## 1. Professional behaviour

Constructive contributions to the DARE UK programme and the broader UK sensitive data research
community are valued and welcomed. We ask that as part of the DARE UK community groups –
specifically Interest Groups (IGs) and Working Groups (WGs) – you strive to ensure others feel equally
valued and welcomed by treating others with the respect and professionalism with which you would expect
and prefer to be treated. The DARE UK programme believes all community group contributors and
participants have:

- The right to be safe from harassment or discrimination in all its forms.
- The right to fully engage in all the activities relevant to the community groups they are a part of.
- The right to have any complaints or concerns investigated.

All members of DARE UK community groups are expected to abide by the following core principles:

- Public Trust – Public trust first, last, and always. DARE UK community groups are expected to
    ensure they have appropriate integration of the publics’ voice within their membership and work.
- Openness – Membership is open to all interested individuals who subscribe to the DARE UK
    programme vision. DARE UK community group meetings and processes are open, and the
    deliverables of DARE UK community groups will be made available and publicly disseminated.
- Inclusive – The DARE UK community groups should encourage broad, balanced, and inclusive
    representation within its memberships and across relevant stakeholder communities.
- Start from where we are – The DARE UK programme and community groups work to join up an
    existing, mature sensitive data research landscape in the UK and co-design with/from existing
    practitioners/components.
- Community-driven – The DARE UK community groups are public, community-driven bodies
    constituted from volunteer members and organisations, supported under the DARE UK programme
    and working towards a shared vision for the UK sensitive data infrastructure landscape.
- Open source first, non-profit, and technology-neutral – The DARE UK programme and its
    community groups do not promote, endorse, or sell commercial products, technologies, or services
    and the development of open and re-usable recommendations and outputs as part of the DARE UK
    programme is mandatory. All foreground IP generated through an interest or working group shall be
    shared as open source under a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) or other equivalent

- The “IETF principle” – DARE UK community groups adhere to the spirit of “rough consensus”
    (where a lack of disagreement is more important than agreement, and where all issues are
    addressed but not necessarily accommodated), looking to nucleate advances in small groups and
    rely on the combined judgement of relevant communities to iteratively move the programme vision
    forward.

## 2. Meeting etiquette

Join on time and come prepared

Please be prompt in arriving to the meeting and in returning from breaks. Be prepared to contribute to
achieving the meeting goals, please read any materials that are sent to you in advance and join the meeting
with a positive and optimistic attitude.

Contribute to the goals of the meeting

Participate by listening, sharing ideas, asking questions, and contributing to discussions. Share your unique
perspectives and experience and speak honestly and transparently. If you state a problem or disagree with
a proposal, try to offer a solution.

Stay on point

Respect the groups’ time and keep comments relevant to the topics being discussed.

Be courteous, respectful, and value the diversity of participants

Honest and constructive conversations and written comments are encouraged and must be conducted
respectfully without blame or judgement on an individual or organisation. Treat all meeting participants
with the same respect you would want from them. Any disruptive behaviour or inappropriate or offensive
comments are unacceptable.

## 3. Production/posting of inappropriate content

DARE UK expects community group members to refrain from the production or posting any of the
following in a DARE UK context:

- Material that infringes the intellectual property rights of another person or entity, including
    insufficient copyright attribution.

- Commercial solicitations.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all DARE UK affiliated meetings, workshops or events, on

#DAREUK).

## 4. Harassment

DARE UK does not tolerate harassment. Harassment includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal or
written comments related to any of the following: gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, colour, race, ethnicity, religion. It can also include
activities related to display of sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical
contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

DARE UK recognises that what is offensive will vary across cultures and individuals. Harassment is defined
from the perspective of the individual who is the target of the harassment. In the case of divergent views,
cases will be presented to the DARE UK Delivery Team and/or Operational Management Group as
appropriate. The DARE UK Director will be the ultimate arbiter.
